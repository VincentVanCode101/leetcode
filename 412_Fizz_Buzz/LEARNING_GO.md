### Explanation of Using a Slice of Structs Instead of a Map

#### Map Approach:
```go
fizzBuzzMap := make(map[int]string)
fizzBuzzMap[3] = "Fizz"
fizzBuzzMap[5] = "Buzz"
```
- **Unordered**: Maps in Go do not maintain the order of keys.
- **Issue**: This can lead to unpredictable concatenation order, resulting in "BuzzFizz" instead of "FizzBuzz".

#### Slice of Structs Approach:
```go
fizzBuzzMap := []struct {
    key   int
    value string
}{
    {3, "Fizz"},
    {5, "Buzz"},
}
```
- **Ordered**: Slices maintain the order of elements.
- **Solution**: Ensures "Fizz" is always processed before "Buzz", producing the correct "FizzBuzz" output.
